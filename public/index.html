    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">For a potential client I would first advise them to have a cybersecurity framework, because then you they can be prepared for the possible risks that can attack the company. To have a security excises will also make them prepared for cyber-attacks. As a front-end developer I would also advise to use proper and secure coding techniques to avoid problems like XSS, CSRF and SQL injection. I would also advice them to renewing passwords for security reasons.
